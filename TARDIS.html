<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about <strong>data wrangling</strong>! For this tutorial,
we’ll analyze one of the greatest datasets ever to grace TidyTuesday…
<strong>Doctor Who</strong>!!</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em>, a British television <em>programme</em> that
aires on BBC, is one of the most popular sci-fi series in history. This
tutorial will use Jonathan Kitt’s <code>datardis</code> package from
TidyTuesday (you can find it <a
href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-11-23/readme.md">here</a>)
to walk through some important data wrangling methods.</p>
<p>A quick note about this package is that it only contains information
from the new <em>Doctor Who</em> series that began in 2005. To be
honest, I haven’t seen much of the original series anyway, but once I
get around to it I’ll find a dataset that includes it and analyze
<em>that!</em></p>
<p>Let’s <strong>wrangle this data</strong>!</p>
<p><img

</div>
<div id="section-initial-peek-at-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial peek at the data</h2>
<p>Let’s start off by seeing what we’re working with.</p>
<p>This package is comprised of a few different datasets:
<code>directors</code>; <code>episodes</code>; <code>writers</code>; and
<code>imdb</code>. Each of these contains slightly different information
about Doctor Who. Let’s look at the column names for each one and see
what information could be most useful or interesting to us.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(directors)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;story_number&quot; &quot;director&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(episodes)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;era&quot;             &quot;season_number&quot;   &quot;serial_title&quot;    &quot;story_number&quot;   
##  [5] &quot;episode_number&quot;  &quot;episode_title&quot;   &quot;type&quot;            &quot;first_aired&quot;    
##  [9] &quot;production_code&quot; &quot;uk_viewers&quot;      &quot;rating&quot;          &quot;duration&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(writers)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;story_number&quot; &quot;writer&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(imdb)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;season&quot;   &quot;ep_num&quot;   &quot;air_date&quot; &quot;rating&quot;   &quot;rating_n&quot; &quot;desc&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It looks like there’s a lot of good info in here, but to be honest, I
find juggling four different datasets really overwhelming. From this, I
can see that although they each contain different information,
<code>story_number</code> is consistent for all but the
<code>imdb</code> dataset. What if we join them all into one, starting
with the <code>story_number</code> column?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-joining-datasets" class="section level2">
<h2>Joining datasets</h2>
<p>I’m going to use <code>full_join()</code> here to avoid losing any
data. This type of join returns <strong>all</strong> rows, regardless of
a match. This is a great join to use if you’re worried about losing
data. There are plenty of other <code>join</code> functions that
prioritize a “master” dataset but we’ll keep it simple and stick with
<code>full_join()</code>.</p>
<p>Because <code>story_number</code> is unique to each episode (even
stories that span over multiple episodes are distinguished by <em>a, b,
c</em>, etc. after each story number) we shouldn’t have an issue with
lost data but it’s good to keep things safe.</p>
<p>Let’s call our new dataset <code>drwho_comp</code>. First, I’ll join
the <code>directors</code> and <code>episode</code> datsets by their
<code>story_number</code> column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_comp = directors %&gt;% 
  full_join(episodes, by = &quot;story_number&quot;)

drwho_comp</code></pre>

<h3>Exercise 2: Second join</h3>
<p>Since we joined <code>writers</code> to <code>drwho_comp</code>, you
might have noticed that we actually <em>gained</em> a few rows. This is
because a few episodes had <strong>multiple authors</strong>.
Fortunately, this keeps our data in the <strong>long format</strong>
(the easier way to work with data: if data can be stored as either a row
or a column, storing it in rows is much better to work with!) and
doesn’t disrupt anything. Still, it’s good to keep in mind as we
continue working with this dataset.</p>
<p>For our final join, we want to include <code>imdb</code> in our
<code>drwho_comp</code> dataset. Unfortunately, <code>imdb</code>
doesn’t have the <code>story_number</code> column like the other three
datasets. Let’s take another peek at the column names and see what we
can use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(drwho_comp)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;story_number&quot;    &quot;director&quot;        &quot;era&quot;             &quot;season_number&quot;  
##  [5] &quot;serial_title&quot;    &quot;episode_number&quot;  &quot;episode_title&quot;   &quot;type&quot;           
##  [9] &quot;first_aired&quot;     &quot;production_code&quot; &quot;uk_viewers&quot;      &quot;rating&quot;         
## [13] &quot;duration&quot;        &quot;writer&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(imdb)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;season&quot;   &quot;ep_num&quot;   &quot;air_date&quot; &quot;rating&quot;   &quot;rating_n&quot; &quot;desc&quot;</code></pre>

<h3>Final join: when columns don’t match!</h3>
<p>The best way that we can join <code>drwho_comp</code> and
<code>imdb</code> is probably by <strong>specific episode</strong>.
Unfortunately, <code>epsiode_number</code> and <code>season</code> are
different columns in both of these datasets; episode 1 can appear many
times because there will always be one “episode 1” for each season! To
join these two datasets, we need to <strong>create a new column</strong>
that contains season <em>and</em> episode number. To do this, we’ll use
the <code>mutate()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package
as well as <code>str_c()</code> from the <code>stringr</code>
package.</p>
<p>We can use <code>mutate()</code> to <strong>add a new column</strong>
to each of our datasets. <code>str_c()</code> will be used to
<strong>combine</strong> the <code>season_number</code> and
<code>episode_number</code> columns into one single
<code>season_and_ep</code> column.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the <code>drwho_comp</code> dataset, 4
episodes were input incorrectly. Those are also fixed below. Next,
because episode 0 was consistently recorded as <code>NA</code>, I
replaced all of those with 0.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># First, the 3 incorrect episodes are fixed
drwho_comp$episode_number[drwho_comp$story_number == 231] &lt;- 6 # change ep number from NA to 6
drwho_comp$episode_number[drwho_comp$story_number == 263] &lt;- 13 # change ep number from NA to 13
drwho_comp$season_number[drwho_comp$story_number == 276] &lt;- 11 # change season number from 10 to 11

# Now we can replace all NA values in `episode_number` with 0 (these are the Christmas specials, recorded as episode 0 in `imdb`)
drwho_comp$episode_number[is.na(drwho_comp$episode_number)] &lt;- 0

# add the season and episode column to `drwho_comp`
drwho_comp = drwho_comp %&gt;% 
  mutate(season_and_ep = str_c(season_number, episode_number, sep = &quot;-&quot;))

# add the season and episode column to `imdb`
imdb = imdb %&gt;% 
  mutate(season_and_ep = str_c(season, ep_num, sep = &quot;-&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s <code>join()</code>!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_comp = drwho_comp %&gt;% 
  full_join(imdb, by = &quot;season_and_ep&quot;)

drwho_comp</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now we <em>finally</em> have all four datasets in one. As I
mentioned before, it’s really nice to have everything in one place.
We’re now free to mess around with everything!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-working-with-our-fancy-new-dataset"
class="section level2">
<h2>Working with our fancy new dataset!</h2>
<p>At this point, our <code>drwho_comp</code> dataset contains all of
the information from each of the four initial datasets that we started
with. Let’s start visualizing some data to start understanding it!</p>
<div id="section-which-season-has-the-best-ratings"
class="section level3">
<h3>Which season has the best ratings?</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the show’s ratings across the seasons. Below is a
<strong>scatterplot</strong> that includes data from each episode.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_comp %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season_and_ep, y = rating.y)) +
  geom_point() </code></pre>
<p><img src="TARDIS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Oof. That’s an overwhelming graph. I don’t even know what the x-axis
says or whether it’s in order or anything! What can we do to improve
this graph?</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="scatter-q" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="scatter-q-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

</div>
<div id="section-using-summarize-and-group_by-to-visualize-data"
class="section level3">
<h3>Using <code>summarize()</code> and <code>group_by()</code> to
visualize data</h3>
<p>Let’s sort our episodes by <strong>season</strong> and graph the
average rating <em>per season</em>. To do this, we can use
<code>mutate()</code> again to create a new column with the average
rating of each season. To get that, we’ll use <code>group_by()</code> to
group the data and follow it with <code>summarize()</code> to summarize
it (I guess these are pretty self-explanatory).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>Do not</strong> end a pipeline with
<code>group_by()</code>!! Always follow it up with
<code>summarize()</code>.</p>
<p>For this, we’ll look at IMDB rating and the episodes included on
IMDB: seasons 1-12</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_avg_rating = drwho_comp %&gt;% 
  group_by(season) %&gt;% # group the entire dataset by `season`
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(rating.y, na.rm = TRUE)) # adds a new column with average rating per season</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s graph this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggthemr(&quot;sky&quot;)
drwho_avg_rating %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = &quot;Season&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;, title = &quot;Average IMDB rating of each Doctor Who season&quot;, subtitle = &quot;since 2006&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1), labels = c(1:12)) +
  geom_curve(x = 9, xend = 10.5, y = 6.5, yend = 6.2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, &quot;inch&quot;)), size = 0.5, curvature = 0.55, color = &quot;#f99e93&quot;) + 
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 9, y = 6.8, size = 4,
           label = &quot;Jodie Whittaker\nbecomes the first\nfemale doctor&quot;) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="TARDIS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>This is interesting — rating absolutely <em>plummets</em> at season
11. One big reason for this is the introduction of the first female
doctor, the lead character in the series. Since its inception in 1963,
the 12 preceding doctors had all been men. Jodie Whittaker, the first
female doctor, has received intense criticism for her role as The
Doctor. It’s definitely an interesting piece of context to include
alongside this graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exercise-3-which-doctor-is-the-best"
class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 3: Which doctor is the best?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned before, there is always a doctor at the center of the
series: a Time Lord that uses regeneration energy to exist within
different bodies. More than just a convenient way to cycle different
actors through this long-running series, this concept is the basis of
the entire show. This means that we get a new doctor every few seasons…
which means that there’s the inevitable debate about which doctor is the
best.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="mattsmith-q" class="tutorial-question panel-body">

<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now that we’re on the same page and have established that Matt Smith
is the best doctor, let’s see how well he did compared to the
others!</p>
<p>First, <em>one more</em> adjustment to add a column with the doctors
in it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># add a new column to store each of the doctors&#39; names
drwho_comp$doctor &lt;- c(&quot;&quot;)

# assign each name to each season or set of seasons
drwho_comp$doctor[drwho_comp$season == 1] &lt;- &quot;Christopher Eccleston&quot;
drwho_comp$doctor[drwho_comp$season %in% c(2:4)] &lt;- &quot;David Tennant&quot; 
drwho_comp$doctor[drwho_comp$season %in% c(5:7)] &lt;- &quot;Matt Smith&quot; 
drwho_comp$doctor[drwho_comp$season %in% c(8:10)] &lt;- &quot;Peter Capaldi&quot; 
drwho_comp$doctor[drwho_comp$season %in% c(11:13)] &lt;- &quot;Jodi Whittaker&quot; </code></pre>
<p>And let’s use the <code>select()</code> function to choose a few
columns from this dataset to look at. This makes it easier to check
whether we’ve done everything right so far since there is less data on
our screen:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_comp %&gt;% 
  select(season_number, episode_title, doctor)</code></pre>

<p>Ok, it looks like everything is all set there!</p>
<p>Now we can look at the data for each doctor! Let’s use the
<code>select()</code> function to get a sense of what we’re looking at.
Once again, let’s make a new dataset to store the
<code>avg_rating</code> per <code>doctor</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Your turn</strong>: Can you adjust the pipeline below to find
the average rating for each doctor? <em>Hint</em>: look at what we did
earlier when we calculated the average rating per season!</p>

<div id="section-visualizing-this-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing this data!</h3>
<p>Now that we have the dataset grouped by each doctor’s average IMDB
rating, let’s see how each one fared.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We’re also useing the <code>filter()</code>
function here to graph only the 5 doctors we’re looking at (i.e., not
the <code>NA</code> values)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_avg_doctor %&gt;% 
  filter(doctor %in% c(&quot;Christopher Eccleston&quot;, &quot;David Tennant&quot;, &quot;Matt Smith&quot;, &quot;Peter Capaldi&quot;, &quot;Jodi Whittaker&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(doctor, avg_rating), y = avg_rating, fill = doctor)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;#1976d2&quot;, &quot;#0d47a1&quot;, &quot;#bbdefb&quot;, &quot;#2196f3&quot;, &quot;#64b5f6&quot;)) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;Average IMDB rating for each doctor in Doctor Who&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="TARDIS_files/figure-html/avgdoc-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>David Tennant is (unsurprisingly) at the top of this list. He’s a fan
favorite, and one of the hottest debates among Doctor Who fans is
whether he or Matt Smith is the better doctor. David Tennant has had
some iconic episodes and deserves his spot at the top… even if Matt
Smith is closer to my heart.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the graph. Christopher Eccleston is a surprising
second on this list. This might be because he only remained one season
while the others stayed for three (it could have been a killer season).
Another might be that he played the Doctor in season 1 of the reboot,
the first season since the 80s. Nostalgic viewers could have bumped
these ratings up for sure. Yet another reason could be that he’s
<em>actually just a great doctor</em> (which he is; if you couldn’t
guess already, I love every doctor).</p>
<p>Again, we see Jodi Whittaker’s rating stands much lower than every
other doctor. The sci-fi community, like many STEM-related communities,
is largely male-dominated. When shows as popular and long-standing as
Doctor Who replace historically male characters with female actors, male
viewers protest (remember the new <a

Wars</a> reviews?).</p>

<div id="section-bonus-matt-smith-vs-david-tennant"
class="section level3">
<h3>Bonus: Matt Smith vs David Tennant</h3>
<p>The two most popular doctors are Matt Smith and David Tennant. Let’s
use our new <strong>data wrangling skills</strong> to compare the
ratings between their episodes! We know that David Tennant’s
<strong>overall</strong> ratings were better, but maybe it will be
interesting to use <code>first_aired</code> (original air date of each
episode) to see how each did over time.</p>
<p>We’ll use <code>drwho_comp</code> again and <code>filter()</code> to
keep <em>only the rows with Matt Smith or David Tennant</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drwho_comp %&gt;% 
  filter(doctor %in% c(&quot;David Tennant&quot;, &quot;Matt Smith&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = first_aired, y = rating.y, color = doctor)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.8, color = &quot;#3f37c9&quot;) +
  facet_wrap(~ doctor, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;David Tennant vs Matt Smith&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Episode IMDB rating over time&quot;, x = &quot;air date&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="TARDIS_files/figure-html/finalgraph-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>It looks like Matt Smith had a more consistent run while David
Tennant had more extreme highs and lows. Overall, it’s not very clear
who did better. Looking back at their average ratings, they weren’t all
that different, anyway; David Tennant averaged an 8.1 while Matt Smith
averaged a 7.97.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Data wrangling is a rabbit hole that you can travel down forever —
especially when you find a great dataset! Thanks for going through this
<strong>Doctor Who</strong> dataset and looking at some ways to wrangle
your data. This article barely scratches the surface of what’s possible
in R; as I said before, the possibilities really are endless! Thanks for
sticking through to the end and have a fantastic day!</p>
